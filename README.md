# COVID-19 Data Analysis (SQL + Tableau)

This project explores the COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data using SQL Server.  
It focuses on analyzing infection, death, and vaccination rates by country and continent, and prepares the data for visualization in Tableau.

Key steps:
- Cleaned and queried COVID-19 deaths and vaccination data
- Calculated infection and death rates relative to population
- Built cumulative vaccination metrics using SQL window functions
- Created a view for seamless Tableau integration

Next step: build interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize trends globally and by region.
