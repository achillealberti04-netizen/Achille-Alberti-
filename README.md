Pandemic-Data-Exploration-SQL

Project Overview

This project is the first part of a broader analytics portfolio where I combine SQL and Tableau to explore, clean, and visualize global COVID-19 data.

The goal is to practice data querying, aggregation, and visualization while answering real-world questions such as:

Which countries had the highest infection and death rates?

How did vaccination campaigns progress across continents?

What is the global death percentage relative to reported cases?

Data Source

Data comes from the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset
.
Two tables were used:

CovidDeaths

CovidVaccinations

Technologies & Tools

SQL Server (data exploration & transformations)

Tableau (data visualization, next step)

Excel (validation and quick checks)

SQL Analysis Highlights

Selected and cleaned COVID-19 death and vaccination data

Analyzed total cases vs deaths to compute death percentages

Calculated total cases vs population for infection rate insights

Identified countries and continents with the highest death tolls

Computed global aggregates of cases and deaths

Created a CTE (Common Table Expression) to calculate cumulative vaccinations over time

Built a SQL View for easier connection to Tableau dashboards

Next Steps

Build interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize:

Global case and death trends

Vaccination rollout by continent

Infection and death rates by country

Extend project to cover macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19
